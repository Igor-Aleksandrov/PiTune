# PiTune
The program for tunning the PID controllers in the automatic process control system.

The project aims: to gain practical experience in software development by C#, to understand how to tune industrial PID controllers for practical use.

Status on 17.06.2020.

1 Several methods for tunning PID for the first-order Transfer Function Model were made.

2 Added recalculation of PID settings for different controller's algorithms.

3 Added UI for the test so far, there PID CentumVP tunning by Ziegler Nichols.

Immediate plans.

1 Combine PID and model to check the operation of the controller with the model.

2 Refactoring the model class, most likely it will consist of different elements (first-order, delays, etc).

3 Using Code Contracts.

4 Develop Unit Tests.


If you have any ideas how to manage the classes in another way, fix the ugly code) or how to improve the program, I will be glad to discuss it.
